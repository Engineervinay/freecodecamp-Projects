            <h3>Here's time line of Srinivasa Ramanujan </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>1887 :</b> born December 22, Kumbakonam, India
                </li>  
                <li>
                    <b>1902 :</b> When he was 15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in
                    Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2 vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems, many presented
                    with only the briefest of proofs and with no material newer than 1860, aroused his genius.Having verified
                    the results in Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems and ideas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1903 :</b> he secured a scholarship to the University of Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other studies in pursuit of mathematics.Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the poorest circumstances.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    <b>1909 :</b> he began a search for permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a government official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post with the Madras Port Trust.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    <b>1911 :</b> Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. His genius slowly gained recognition.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    <b>1913 :</b> he began a correspondence with the British mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy that led to a special scholarship from the University of Madras and a grant from Trinity College, Cambridge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1914 :</b>Overcoming his religious objections, Ramanujan traveled to England, where Hardy tutored him and collaborated with him in some research.
                    <br>
                    Ramanujan’s knowledge of mathematics (most of which he had worked out for himself) was startling. Although he was almost completely unaware of modern developments in mathematics, his mastery of continued fractions was unequaled by any living mathematician. He worked out the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, the functional equations of the zeta function, and his own theory of divergent series, in which he found a value for the sum of such series using a technique he invented that came to be called Ramanujan summation. On the other hand, he knew nothing of doubly periodic functions, the classical theory of quadratic forms, or Cauchy’s theorem, and he had only the most nebulous idea of what constitutes a mathematical proof. Though brilliant, many of his theorems on the theory of prime numbers were wrong.
                    In England Ramanujan made further advances, especially in the partition of numbers (the number of ways that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of positive integers; e.g., 4 can be expressed as 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1).           </li>     
                <li>
                    <b>1918 :</b>His papers were published in English and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected to the Royal Society of London.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1917 :</b>Ramanujan had contracted tuberculosis.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1919 :</b>his condition improved sufficiently for him to return to India.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1920 :</b> He died generally unknown to the world at large but recognized by mathematicians as a phenomenal genius, without peer since Leonhard Euler (1707–83) and Carl Jacobi (1804–51). Ramanujan left behind three notebooks and a sheaf of pages (also called the “lost notebook”) containing many unpublished results that mathematicians continued to verify long after his death.
